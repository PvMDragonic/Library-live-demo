# Library Website live-demo
This is a custom build of my Library Website project meant to work as a static page, without a server for back-end. It runs straight and only from the browser by using IndexedDB for data storage.

The orignal project's repostory can be found **[here](https://github.com/PvMDragonic/Library-website)**.
